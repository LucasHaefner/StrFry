Description: 
        # StrFry - The easiest way to create human-readable tables in Python!
        
        # Overview
        Strfry allows users to manipulate tables, making them easier to read both for humans and machines.
        
        ## What is a table?
        A table is simply a iterable of one or more iterable. Lists are recommended, as most functions and methods won't work on immutables or non-iterables.
        
        # Class Heirarchy:
        
        
        ## Table(table, separators, sort)
        
        	- separate()
        	- normalize()
        	- flip()
        	- align()
        	- saute()
