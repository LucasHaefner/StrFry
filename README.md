# StrFry - The easiest way to create human-readable tables in Python!

# Overview
Strfry allows users to manipulate tables, making them easier to read both for humans and machines.

## What is a table?
A table is simply a iterable of one or more iterable. Lists are recommended, as most functions and methods won't work on immutables or non-iterables.

# Class Heirarchy:


## Table(table, separators, sort)

	- separate()
	- normalize()
	- flip()
	- align()

## ...More being added!

## Getting started

To download strfry, either fork this github repo or simply use PyPi via pip.
```sh
$ pip install strfry
```
